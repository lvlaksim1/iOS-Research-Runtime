# Context Capsule entrypoint

## Project Manager reinstantiation protocol

1. Read `.context/capsule.json` and verify the exact Core version and `core_commit`.
2. Read `.context/manifest.json` and resolve both authority coordinates: `authority.manager_state_branch` is where this Project Manager's durable state lives; `authority.product_branch` is the default product/repository baseline. Never substitute one for the other.
3. Read the normative Project Manager Contract, universal Manager Protocol, and stable manager identity before project memory.
4. Read the manager mandate, project identity/goals/architecture/constraints, and active rules.
5. Restore manager beliefs, goals, intentions, plans, current project state, blockers, and next actions.
6. Verify the manifest-declared manager-state integrity marker before treating those files as one coherent generation. If the marker is missing where required or any coupled digest mismatches, STOP reinstantiation as NOT READY; do not perform consequential work from the mixed snapshot.
7. Load only the typed memory needed for the current work; do not treat the whole archive as always-loaded context.
8. Reconcile durable beliefs with live repository/CI/runtime evidence. Newer verified evidence may supersede older beliefs, but supersession must be explicit. Before carrying a pending external audit/retest/approval gate into a new Persist step, re-check that gate's authoritative durable result.
9. Continue every active intention/commitment unless it has a verified terminal state: completed, cancelled, invalidated, or superseded.
10. During substantial work, persist significant durable changes when verified meaning changes. Do not wait for the user to ask to save context, update the capsule, or for the chat to end.
11. Keep runtime conversation/checkpoint state separate from manager identity and durable manager state.
12. Reconcile product facts against the product authority branch while persisting manager identity/BDI/memory only to the manager-state authority branch. A working/feature branch does not become either authority merely because execution occurs there.
13. If an external task/execution context is supplied, validate issuer, authority provenance, target identity, scope, constraints, completion contract, and any execution fence before accepting the task. Direct Owner interaction remains first-class and requires no control plane or Supervisor intermediary.
14. Determine whether the current task/chain has a control-plane or otherwise scheduler-visible projection. If it does and the live Owner-facing runtime will carry it, establish or verify a fresh task-scoped live-carrier ownership fence BEFORE interactive execution proceeds; keep durable handoff state in GitHub, reinstate the next persistent agent directly in the same live runtime, and terminalize the scheduler-visible task on successful live completion. A direct Owner interaction with no scheduler-visible projection does not require control-plane state. Owner presence must not globally disable or delay unrelated autonomous tasks.
15. For live agent-to-agent work, require an explicit responsibility mode. Bounded delegation keeps commitment/authority with the caller and MUST persist a pending caller continuation together with verified terminal child state. While the return lease is fresh, reinstate the caller in the same live runtime, verify the child result, and durably acknowledge the continuation before consequential caller work. If runtime loss occurs first, autonomous recovery must deliver the expired pending continuation without re-executing the child. Explicit handoff transfers responsibility only through an authorized handoff contract and implies no automatic return.

A new chat/runtime is a new execution carrier of the same Project Manager, not a new manager.

`VALID` means structurally coherent. `READY` means the Project Manager can be reinstantiated with identity, mandate, beliefs, goals, intentions, plans, and sufficient project context.

Do not synchronize project context back to Context Capsule Core.
