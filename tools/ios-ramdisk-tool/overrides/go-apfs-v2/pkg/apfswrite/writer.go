// or above it, so an inode number identifies a file across the pair. The flag
// is set on both members, so it alone does not say which half a volume is; the
// role does, and only the system volume shifts.
//
// The reserved numbers below MIN_USER_INO_NUM do not shift, which is where the
// spec and Apple's own tools disagree. The spec (Inode Numbers) says the system
// volume "reserves each of the inode numbers listed above but with
// UNIFIED_ID_SPACE_MARK added to them", giving 0x0800000000000002 for its root

// special dentries. Its reserved-inode test is plainly oid < MIN_USER_INO_NUM
